goal:
  before: |
    We’re going to look at how to use `transform`, `transition`, `animation` and `:target` while creating a mock news reader.

    The red diamond badge should pulse. Clicking on each tab should display a different thing on the screen.
  notes:
    - label: "Type it, type it real good"
      text: "Remember the purpose of this lesson is to type the code out yourself—build up that muscle memory in your fingers!"

steps:
  - title: "Set up project"
    before: |
      Before we get started, create some files and get ready.
    folders:
      - label: "news-reader"
        type: folder
      - label: "index.html"
        indent: 1
      - label: "css"
        type: folder
        indent: 1
      - label: "main.css"
        indent: 2
    after: |
      1. Create a folder named `news-reader`
      2. Make an `index.html` & add the boilerplate code.
      4. Make a `main.css` in your `css` folder & add the boilerplate code.
    notes:
      - label: "Naming conventions"
        text: "Don’t forget to follow the [naming conventions](/topics/naming-paths-cheat-sheet/#naming-conventions)."
      - label: "HTML snippets"
        text: "Create the boilerplate with `html5`, `viewport`, `css`"
      - label: "CSS snippets"
        text: "Create the boilerplate with `cssviewport`, `borderbox`, `textsize`"

  - title: "Write the HTML"
    before: |
      Here’s the HTML we need to make the news reader interface.

          The `transition` is always on the default state—not where the properties change.
          - `all` — animate all the CSS properties that change.
          - `500ms` — the duration of the animation.
          - `linear` — the easing; `linear` means no easing.
      - num: "27-30"
        text: "Change a few CSS properties when the element is hovered. Only properties that are numbers can be transitioned. When the element is interacted with the transition will occur."
      - num: 38
        text: |
          Use `calc()` to perfectly centre the element. Because its `left` is `50%`, it isn’t perfectly centred—its left edge is at the centre.

          So, using `calc()` we bump it back by half its width—making it perfectly centred.
      - num: 39
        text: "Use `transform` to rotate the `<i>` tag so it visually looks like a diamond."
      - num: 40
        text: |
          Add an automatically playing `animation` to the badge.
          - `pulse` — the name of the keyframes to use.
          - `1s` — the duration of the animation; could also be specified in `ms`
          - `linear` — the easing; `linear` means no easing.
          - `infinite` — how many times the animation should play; could be just a number.
          - `alternate` — tells the animation to play forward through the keyframes, then backward.
      - num: "43-52"
        text: |
          The keyframes block of an animation. All keyframe blocks need to be given a name.

          Keyframes are specified in percent so they aren’t tied to a specific duration. There can be as many percentage-based keyframes as you want—including decimals like `57.4%`

          Within each keyframe we only need to specify the CSS properties that are going to change. Any property that is a number can be animated.
      - num: "58-60"
        text: |
          By default the `.panel` is hidden (shown in the CSS above).

          When it’s `id` is found in the URL, aka it’s the target, add this CSS to it. So, when `.panel` is targetted it becomes visible with `display: block`
