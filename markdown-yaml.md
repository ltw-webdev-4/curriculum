      ## Content & data

      Markup languages like HTML for representing content & data

      - *Markdown* — simplified HTML
      - *YAML* — simplified JavaScript data

      *Can be combined together: Markdown in YAML & YAML in Markdown*

      - They’re ubiquitous & standardized (mostly)
      - They can be written without special tools

      ## Extensions & editors

      Use Atom or Sublime or anything for editing

      *Atom provides built-in Markdown preview:*

      `Packages > Markdown Preview`

  - type: code
    markdown: |
      # For heading level 1                         <!-- Denote headings with # -->
      ## For heading level 2
      ### For heading level 3

      - List item 1                                 <!-- Unordered list -->
      - List item

      1. Numbered list item 1                       <!-- Ordered list -->
      2. Numbered list item 2

      Just a *plain* old **paragraph**!             <!-- Paragraphs are just lines by themselves -->
                                                    <!-- Single * is italic. Double ** is bold -->
