      ## What & why

      We’re going to explore creating data structures that are common to programming—by describing fries.

      Often information needs to be structured with a limited set of data types.

      **Data structuring is critical to understanding configuration, documentation, & information storage.**

      ## Data structures

      - `string` — just some text
      - `number` — just a number
      - `boolean` — `true` or `false`
      - `array` — a collection, like `<ol>`
      - `object` — a named collection, like `<dl>`

      ## Simple example

      ```yml
      description: "Shoe string"
      thickness: 5
      spices:
        - "Oregano"
        - "Peri Peri"
      ```

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      2. Get assigned some fries
      3. Get a pencil & a piece of paper
      4. Describe the chip’s attributes using data structures
        <br>**In a way that would work for all fries**
      5. Present the structure so we can build a specification
